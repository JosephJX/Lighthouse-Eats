## The LighthouseEats

- This is our desktop app to provide an online food ordering experience.
- The layout of this app is designed be similar to an ubereats checkout.
- Add to cart Icons underneath each item should trigger code which will update the cart when clicked which will update a counter incrementally with every click
- Once complete, cart should take the user to middle page with a summary of all the items in the cart
- User should then confirm items, present payment and proceed to order status page
- Order status page displays a timer which will give the user an estimate for how long the order will take
- Order status page should also feature a twilio API which will send SMS notification to restaurant with the users order as well as send an SMS notification to the user with updates on the order.
- For ease of use and UX experience google maps api was also implemented in order to give directions in case the user wanted to pick up the order from the restaurant.
